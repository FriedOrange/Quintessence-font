Quintessence: font for Quikscript
=================================

Version 1.000
Copyright Brad Neil, 2023

These fonts are distributed in two formats: TTF for installation on computers; and WOFF for embedding in Web pages. The source code for generating the fonts is available on Github [1]. The Quikscript characters are mapped to the Unicode Private Use Area, so youâ€™ll need to install a special keyboard layout to type with them. Finally, the fonts are all available under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 [2]. This means they may be freely used, distributed, extended and adapted.

This font is intended to embody the quintessence of the Quikscript alphabet. The Quikscript letters are based on the writing samples found in the Quikscript Manual; I have taken no liberties with their design. Most of the numerals and other symbols follow the forms used in my own handwriting. All glyphs are monolinear with rounded endings, in order to get as close as possible to their unadorned skeletons.

The font contains extensive kerning, plus ligatures (accessible through the liga OpenType feature) for the abbreviations described in the Quikscript Manual: Mr, Ms, Dr and etc.

FontForge lacks good facilities for designing stroked glyphs, so everything was first drawn in Inkscape. I used a batch script to automatically convert the stroke information to outlines suitable for importation to FontForge; a Python script automated that importation. All of this made it much easier to iterate designs, and make something as well-polished as I reasonably could.

Quintessence replaces my earlier fonts, all unfinished previously unreleased: QS Manual (2020; previously used for the alphabet chart and other Quikscript text on my website), Gateway Hand (2018) and Gateway Rounded (2017) [3].
